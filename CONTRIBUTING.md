## Why to contribute?
Why do people contribute to open source? Plenty of reasons!   
- **Improve existing skills**   
Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
- **Meet people who are interested in similar things**  
Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.
- **Find mentors and teach others**	  
Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
- **Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)**  
By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.
- **Learn people skills**  
Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.
- **It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones**  
You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.

## On what to contribute? 
- **You don’t have to contribute code**  
A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. 
 
- **Do you like planning events?**  
- **Do you like to design?**  
- **Do you like to write?**
- **Do you like organizing?**
- **Do you like to code?**
- **Do you like helping people?**
- **Do you like helping others code?**
