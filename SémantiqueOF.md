Makers  
Valeurs :  
_MAKE  
Making is fundamental to what it means to be human. We must make, create, and express ourselves to feel whole. There is something unique about  making physical things. These things are like little pieces of us and seem to embody portions of our souls.  
_SHARE  
Sharing what you have made and what you know about making with others is the method by which a maker’s feeling of wholeness is achieved. You cannot make and not share.  
_GIVE  
There are few things more selfless and satisfying than giving away something you have made. The act of making puts a small piece of you in the object. Giving that to someone else is like giving someone a small piece of yourself. Such things are often the most cherished items we possess.  
_LEARN  
You must learn to make. You must always seek to learn more about your making. You may become a journeyman or master craftsman, but you will still learn, want to learn, and push yourself to learn new techniques, materials, and processes. Building a lifelong learning path ensures a rich and rewarding making life and, importantly, enables one to share.  
_TOOL UP  
You must have access to the right tool for the project  at hand. Invest in and develop local access to the tools you need to do the making you want to do. The tools of making have never been cheaper, easier to use, or more powerful.  
_PLAY  
Be playful with what you are making, and you will be surprised, excited, and proud of what you discover.  
_PARTICIPATE  
Join the Maker Movement and reach out to those around you who are discovering the joy of making. Hold seminars, parties, events, maker days, fairs, expos, classes, and dinners with and for the other makers in your community.  
_SUPPORT  
This is a movement, and it requires emotional, intellectual, financial, political, and institutional support. The best hope for improving the world is us,  and we are responsible for making a better future.  
_CHANGE  
Embrace the change that will naturally occur as you go through your maker journey. Since making is fundamental to what it means to be human, you will become a more complete version of you as you make.
